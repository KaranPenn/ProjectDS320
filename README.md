## Kaggle Project PUBG

### Introduction

In a PUBG game, approximately 100 players start the game. These players could be in teams (groupId) which get ranked after each game (winPlacePerc) based on how many other teams are still alive when they are eliminated. In game, players can pick up different munitions, revive downed-but-not-out (knocked) teammates, drive vehicles, swim, run, shoot, and experience all of the consequences -- such as falling too far or running themselves over and eliminating themselves.

Kaggle has provided alarge number of anonymized PUBG game(Mobile Game) stats, formatted so that each row contains one player's post-game stats. The data comes from matches of all types: solos, duos, squads, and custom; there is no guarantee of there being 100 players per match, nor at most 4 player per group.

### Aim

The aim of this project is to create a machine learning based algorithm on a real-world dataset from Kaggle’s PUBG Mobile game competition which predicts players’(game players’) finishing placement(rank) based on their final stats(features), on a scale from 1 (first place) to 0 (last place) .
